# gd-socks5
A Geometry Dash Mod to Connect Your Client To a socks5 socks4 or http proxy 
Inspired by OnionDash

## Note
- This mod is mainly a social experiment. I am not trying to inspire a new wave of 
threat actors onto gd note that the gd's overall security is very strong. 
- Please do not use these tools to evade comment bans Or Other Nefarious Purposes.

## Proxy Not Connecting Or Can't Find a Proxy to Use
I wrote a [python script](https://github.com/CallocGD/Probe) for hunting down 
proxies to test if the firewall will scream at it or not. As well as for testing
Connectivity while also keeping sever communication minimal.
